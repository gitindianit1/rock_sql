🧠 SQL is the Brain. BI Tools are the Face.
✔️ SQL lets you talk directly to your database — extract, filter, join, and clean data with full control.
✔️ Power BI / Tableau are great for visualizing and sharing insights — but they depend on clean, structured data.

🚀 Here’s What SQL Unlocks:
✅ Custom Queries – go beyond UI filters
✅ Joins – combine data across multiple tables
✅ Data Cleaning – fix missing values, remove duplicates
✅ Performance – query only what you need
✅ Automation – schedule and reuse SQL scripts
✅ Better Control – especially with large datasets
