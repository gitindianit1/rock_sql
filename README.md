🧠 SQL is the Brain. BI Tools are the Face.
✔️ SQL lets you talk directly to your database — extract, filter, join, and clean data with full control.
✔️ Power BI / Tableau are great for visualizing and sharing insights — but they depend on clean, structured data.

🚀 Here’s What SQL Unlocks:
✅ Custom Queries – go beyond UI filters
✅ Joins – combine data across multiple tables
✅ Data Cleaning – fix missing values, remove duplicates
✅ Performance – query only what you need
✅ Automation – schedule and reuse SQL scripts
✅ Better Control – especially with large datasets

In SQL, both subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are mechanisms used to structure and manage complex queries, 
but they differ in their definition and usage.

Subquery
A subquery, also known as an inner query or nested query, is a SELECT statement embedded within another SQL query. 
It executes first, and its result is then used by the outer query. Subqueries can be used in various clauses, 
including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, HAVING, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
